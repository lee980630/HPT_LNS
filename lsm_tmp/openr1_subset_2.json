                "content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the speed of the ship in still water and the speed of the river. Let me start by recalling that when a ship is moving upstream, its effective speed is the speed of the ship minus the speed of the river. Conversely, when moving downstream, its effective speed is the ship's speed plus the river's speed. \n\nLet me denote the speed of the ship in still water as \\( v \\) (in km\/h) and the speed of the river as \\( r \\) (also in km\/h). Then, the upstream speed would be \\( v - r \\), and the downstream speed would be \\( v + r \\).\n\nThe problem mentions three different journeys:\n\n1. 24 km upstream and 28 km downstream, taking half an hour less than the second journey.\n2. 30 km upstream and 21 km downstream, which takes half an hour more than the first journey.\n3. 15 km upstream and 42 km downstream, which takes half an hour less than the first journey.\n\nWait, actually, the problem states: \"For this journey, it took half an hour less than for traveling 30 km upstream and 21 km downstream, or half an hour more than for traveling 15 km upstream and 42 km downstream...\"\n\nHmm, let me parse that again. The first journey (24 km upstream, 28 km downstream) took half an hour less than the journey with 30 km upstream and 21 km downstream. Alternatively, it took half an hour more than the journey with 15 km upstream and 42 km downstream. So, there are two comparisons here:\n\n- Time for 24 up + 28 down = Time for 30 up + 21 down - 0.5 hours\n- Time for 24 up + 28 down = Time for 15 up + 42 down + 0.5 hours\n\nTherefore, we can set up two equations based on these time differences.\n\nFirst, let me express the time taken for each journey. Time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, for the first journey (24 km up, 28 km down):\n\nTime1 = \\( \\frac{24}{v - r} + \\frac{28}{v + r} \\)\n\nFor the second journey (30 km up, 21 km down):\n\nTime2 = \\( \\frac{30}{v - r} + \\frac{21}{v + r} \\)\n\nAccording to the problem, Time1 = Time2 - 0.5\n\nSimilarly, for the third journey (15 km up, 42 km down):\n\nTime3 = \\( \\frac{15}{v - r} + \\frac{42}{v + r} \\)\n\nAnd here, Time1 = Time3 + 0.5\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{24}{v - r} + \\frac{28}{v + r} = \\frac{30}{v - r} + \\frac{21}{v + r} - 0.5 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{24}{v - r} + \\frac{28}{v + r} = \\frac{15}{v - r} + \\frac{42}{v + r} + 0.5 \\)\n\nOkay, so now I need to solve these two equations for \\( v \\) and \\( r \\).\n\nLet me first work on the first equation:\n\n\\( \\frac{24}{v - r} + \\frac{28}{v + r} = \\frac{30}{v - r} + \\frac{21}{v + r} - 0.5 \\)\n\nLet me subtract \\( \\frac{24}{v - r} + \\frac{28}{v + r} \\) from both sides, but maybe it's better to bring all terms to the left side:\n\n\\( \\frac{24}{v - r} + \\frac{28}{v + r} - \\frac{30}{v - r} - \\frac{21}{v + r} + 0.5 = 0 \\)\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\nFor the upstream terms: \\( 24 - 30 = -6 \\), so \\( \\frac{-6}{v - r} \\)\n\nFor the downstream terms: \\( 28 - 21 = 7 \\), so \\( \\frac{7}{v + r} \\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( \\frac{-6}{v - r} + \\frac{7}{v + r} + 0.5 = 0 \\)\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation:\n\n\\( \\frac{24}{v - r} + \\frac{28}{v + r} - \\frac{15}{v - r} - \\frac{42}{v + r} - 0.5 = 0 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\nUpstream terms: \\( 24 - 15 = 9 \\), so \\( \\frac{9}{v - r} \\)\n\nDownstream terms: \\( 28 - 42 = -14 \\), so \\( \\frac{-14}{v + r} \\)\n\nThus:\n\n\\( \\frac{9}{v - r} - \\frac{14}{v + r} - 0.5 = 0 \\)\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\( -\\frac{6}{v - r} + \\frac{7}{v + r} + 0.5 = 0 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{9}{v - r} - \\frac{14}{v + r} - 0.5 = 0 \\)\n\nLet me denote \\( x = \\frac{1}{v - r} \\) and \\( y = \\frac{1}{v + r} \\). Then, the equations become:\n\n1. \\( -6x + 7y + 0.5 = 0 \\) ⇒ \\( -6x + 7y = -0.5 \\)\n2. \\( 9x - 14y - 0.5 = 0 \\) ⇒ \\( 9x - 14y = 0.5 \\)\n\nNow, we have a system of linear equations:\n\nEquation (1): \\( -6x + 7y = -0.5 \\)\n\nEquation (2): \\( 9x - 14y = 0.5 \\)\n\nLet me solve this system using the elimination method. Let's multiply Equation (1) by 2 to make the coefficients of y terms opposites:\n\nEquation (1) multiplied by 2: \\( -12x + 14y = -1 \\)\n\nNow, add this to Equation (2):\n\n\\( (-12x + 14y) + (9x -14y) = -1 + 0.5 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( -3x = -0.5 \\)\n\nThus, \\( x = (-0.5)\/(-3) = 0.5\/3 ≈ 0.1667 \\)\n\nBut exact value is \\( x = 1\/6 \\)\n\nNow, substitute \\( x = 1\/6 \\) back into Equation (1):\n\n\\( -6*(1\/6) + 7y = -0.5 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( -1 + 7y = -0.5 \\)\n\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n\n7y = 0.5\n\nThus, \\( y = 0.5\/7 = 1\/14 ≈ 0.0714 \\)\n\nSo, \\( x = 1\/6 \\) and \\( y = 1\/14 \\)\n\nRecall that \\( x = \\frac{1}{v - r} = 1\/6 \\) ⇒ \\( v - r = 6 \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( y = \\frac{1}{v + r} = 1\/14 \\) ⇒ \\( v + r = 14 \\)\n\nTherefore, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\( v - r = 6 \\)\n2. \\( v + r = 14 \\)\n\nAdding these equations:\n\n\\( (v - r) + (v + r) = 6 + 14 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 2v = 20 \\) ⇒ \\( v = 10 \\)\n\nSubstituting back into \\( v + r = 14 \\):\n\n\\( 10 + r = 14 \\) ⇒ \\( r = 4 \\)\n\nSo, the speed of the ship in still water is 10 km\/h, and the speed of the river is 4 km\/h.\n\nLet me verify these results by plugging them back into the original time equations.\n\nFirst journey: 24\/(10-4) + 28\/(10+4) = 24\/6 + 28\/14 = 4 + 2 = 6 hours.\n\nSecond journey: 30\/(10-4) + 21\/(10+4) = 30\/6 + 21\/14 = 5 + 1.5 = 6.5 hours. So, 6.5 - 0.5 = 6 hours, which matches the first journey. Good.\n\nThird journey: 15\/(10-4) + 42\/(10+4) = 15\/6 + 42\/14 = 2.5 + 3 = 5.5 hours. Then, 5.5 + 0.5 = 6 hours, which also matches the first journey. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe speed of the ship in still water is \\boxed{10} km\/h and the speed of the river is \\boxed{4} km\/h.\n<\/think>\n\nLet \\( v \\) be the speed of the ship in still water (in km\/h) and \\( r \\) be the speed of the river (in km\/h). The effective speeds of the ship upstream and downstream are \\( v - r \\) and \\( v + r \\), respectively.\n\nWe are given three journeys with the following time relationships:\n1. The journey of 24 km upstream and 28 km downstream takes half an hour less than the journey of 30 km upstream and 21 km downstream.\n2. The journey of 24 km upstream and 28 km downstream takes half an hour more than the journey of 15 km upstream and 42 km downstream.\n\nWe set up the equations for the times taken for each journey:\n1. For the first journey (24 km upstream, 28 km downstream):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{24}{v - r} + \\frac{28}{v + r}\n   \\]\n2. For the second journey (30 km upstream, 21 km downstream):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{30}{v - r} + \\frac{21}{v + r}\n   \\]\n3. For the third journey (15 km upstream, 42 km downstream):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{15}{v - r} + \\frac{42}{v + r}\n   \\]\n\nThe time relationships give us the following equations:\n1. \\[\n   \\frac{24}{v - r} + \\frac{28}{v + r} = \\frac{30}{v - r} + \\frac{21}{v + r} - 0.5\n   \\]\n2. \\[\n   \\frac{24}{v - r} + \\frac{28}{v + r} = \\frac{15}{v - r} + \\frac{42}{v + r} + 0.5\n   \\]\n\nIntroducing variables \\( x = \\frac{1}{v - r} \\) and \\( y = \\frac{1}{v + r} \\), we transform the equations into:\n1. \\[\n   -6x + 7y = -0.5\n   \\]\n2. \\[\n   9x - 14y = 0.5\n   \\]\n\nSolving this system of linear equations:\n1.

                "content":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, a construction company was building a tunnel. When 1\/3 of the tunnel was completed at the original speed, they started using new equipment. This new equipment increased their construction speed by 20% and reduced their working hours to 80% of the original. The total time taken with the new equipment was 185 days. We need to find out how many days it would have taken if they hadn't used the new equipment and continued at the original speed.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. Let's denote the total length of the tunnel as 1 unit for simplicity. So, they completed 1\/3 of the tunnel at the original speed. Then, the remaining 2\/3 was completed with the new equipment, which made them 20% faster and working 80% of the original hours per day.\n\nWait, the problem says \"reduced the working hours to 80% of the original.\" So, their daily working hours are now 80% of what they used to be. But their speed increased by 20%. So, the rate at which they construct the tunnel per day is affected both by the speed increase and the reduction in working hours.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables. Let's let the original construction speed be \"v\" units per day. Wait, but actually, maybe it's better to think in terms of time. Let me think. Suppose the original rate is such that without any changes, they would take T days to complete the tunnel. So, total work is 1 tunnel, original time is T days. Therefore, original rate is 1\/T tunnels per day.\n\nBut when they started, they completed 1\/3 of the tunnel at the original speed, then switched to the new equipment for the remaining 2\/3. The total time taken was 185 days. We need to find T.\n\nWait, but maybe we need to relate the original time to the actual time taken with the changes. Let me approach step by step.\n\nFirst, original total time would be T days. But they didn't complete the tunnel in T days; instead, they changed their equipment partway. Let's think about the two phases: Phase 1 is building 1\/3 of the tunnel at original speed, and Phase 2 is building 2\/3 at the new speed with reduced working hours.\n\nLet me define the original rate as R (tunnel per day). Then, the original time to complete the whole tunnel would be T = 1\/R days.\n\nIn Phase 1, they built 1\/3 of the tunnel at rate R. So, the time taken for Phase 1 is (1\/3)\/R = 1\/(3R) days.\n\nIn Phase 2, they have 2\/3 of the tunnel left. Their speed increases by 20%, so the new speed is R + 20% of R = 1.2R. However, their working hours are reduced to 80% of the original. If the original working hours per day are H, then the new working hours are 0.8H. But how does this affect the construction rate?\n\nWait, speed is in tunnel per day, which is dependent on how much they work each day. If their speed was originally R tunnels per day with H hours per day, then their rate per hour is R\/H tunnels per hour. When they increase their speed by 20%, that would be 1.2*(R\/H) tunnels per hour. But they also reduce their working hours to 0.8H. Therefore, the new daily rate is 1.2*(R\/H) * 0.8H = 1.2*0.8*R = 0.96R tunnels per day. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, maybe. Let me clarify. The original rate is R tunnels per day, which is based on working H hours per day. So, per hour, they complete R\/H tunnels. If their speed (efficiency) increases by 20%, then their per hour rate becomes 1.2*(R\/H). However, they are now working only 0.8H hours per day, so the new daily rate is 1.2*(R\/H) * 0.8H = 1.2*0.8*R = 0.96R. So, their daily rate actually decreases to 0.96R? Wait, that seems counterintuitive. If they work faster but fewer hours, the net effect is a decrease in daily rate? Hmm.\n\nWait, but 20% faster in speed, but 20% less time working. Let me check the math. If original rate is R per day (H hours). Then per hour rate is R\/H. After 20% increase, per hour rate is 1.2R\/H. Then, working 0.8H hours per day, so daily rate is 1.2R\/H * 0.8H = 0.96R. So yes, the daily rate becomes 0.96R. So even though they are working faster, the reduction in hours leads to a lower daily rate. Therefore, the time taken for Phase 2 is (2\/3)\/0.96R days.\n\nBut total time is 185 days, so:\n\nTime for Phase 1 + Time for Phase 2 = 185\n\nWhich is:\n\n1\/(3R) + (2\/3)\/(0.96R) = 185\n\nWe can solve for R, then T = 1\/R is the original total time.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, let's write the equation:\n\n1\/(3R) + (2\/3)\/(0.96R) = 185\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n[1\/3 + (2\/3)\/0.96] \/ R = 185\n\nCalculate the numerator:\n\n1\/3 + (2\/3)\/0.96\n\nFirst compute (2\/3)\/0.96:\n\n2\/3 divided by 0.96 = (2\/3)*(100\/96) = (2\/3)*(25\/24) = (50\/72) = 25\/36 ≈ 0.6944\n\nThen add 1\/3: 1\/3 ≈ 0.3333, so total ≈ 0.6944 + 0.3333 ≈ 1.0277\n\nSo numerator ≈ 1.0277\n\nTherefore, 1.0277 \/ R = 185\n\nSo R ≈ 1.0277 \/ 185 ≈ 0.005555 tunnels per day\n\nTherefore, original time T = 1\/R ≈ 1 \/ 0.005555 ≈ 180 days\n\nWait, so is T 180 days? Let me check the exact calculation instead of approximating.\n\nLet me compute 1\/3 + (2\/3)\/0.96 exactly.\n\nFirst, (2\/3)\/0.96:\n\n0.96 is 24\/25, so dividing by 24\/25 is multiplying by 25\/24.\n\nThus, (2\/3)*(25\/24) = (50\/72) = 25\/36.\n\nThen 1\/3 is 12\/36, so 12\/36 + 25\/36 = 37\/36.\n\nTherefore, numerator is 37\/36.\n\nSo the equation is (37\/36)\/R = 185\n\nHence, R = 37\/(36*185) = 37\/(6660) = 1\/180 per day.\n\nTherefore, T = 1\/R = 180 days.\n\nSo the original time would be 180 days.\n\nWait, so the answer is 180 days? Let me confirm.\n\nIf original time is 180 days, then original rate is 1\/180 per day.\n\nPhase 1: 1\/3 of the tunnel at 1\/180 per day. Time = (1\/3)\/(1\/180) = 60 days.\n\nPhase 2: 2\/3 of the tunnel at the new rate. The new rate is 0.96*(1\/180) = 0.96\/180 = 0.005333... per day.\n\nTime for Phase 2: (2\/3)\/0.005333... = (2\/3)\/(0.005333...) ≈ (2\/3)\/ (8\/1500) ) Because 0.005333 is 8\/1500.\n\nWait, 0.005333... is 8\/1500? Let me check. 8 divided by 1500 is 0.005333..., yes.\n\nSo (2\/3) divided by (8\/1500) = (2\/3)*(1500\/8) = (3000\/24) = 125 days.\n\nWait, 60 days + 125 days = 185 days, which matches the given total time. Therefore, the original time T is indeed 180 days. So the answer is 180.\n\nTherefore, if they had not used the new equipment, it would have taken 180 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{180}\n<\/think>\n\nLet \\( T \\) be the original number of days required to complete the tunnel.
